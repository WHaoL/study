Some programs read cin for their input.
Sample data files are in the data directory:

     File           Programs that use that input file
     ----           --------
   add_item         add_item		1
   add_item         add_itemV2		1
   add_item         fileio			1
   sstream          sstream			1
   sstream          fileio (Note, fileio reads both add_item and sstream)	1

Programs not listed above print output and do
not read any input
